A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax for this is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.
A sample loop will be

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
Input Format

You will be given two positive integers, a and b (a<=b), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer n in the interval [a,b] :

If 1<=n<=9, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
Else if n>9 and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if n>9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".
Note: 

Sample Input

8
11

Sample Output

eight
nine
even
odd




Code:


#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int a, b, i;
   cin>>a>>b;
   for(i=a; i<=b; i++)
    if (1 <= i && i <= 9)
    switch(i)
    {
    case 1:
      cout << "one"<<endl;
      break;
    case 2:
      cout << "two" << endl;
      break;
    case 3:
      cout <<"three"<<endl;
      break;
    case 4:
      cout <<"four"<<endl;
      break;
    case 5:
      cout <<"five"<<endl;
      break;
    case 6:
      cout <<"six"<<endl;
      break;
    case 7:
      cout <<"seven"<<endl;
      break;
    case 8:
      cout << "eight" << endl;
      break;
    case 9:
      cout << "nine" << endl;
      break;
    }
    else if (i>9) {
        if(i%2==0)
        {
          cout << "even" << endl;
        }
        else {
          cout << "odd" << endl;
        }
    }

      return 0;
}
